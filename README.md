# [Project 2 Unsupervised-Predict-Streamlit](https://github.com/Oluwaleke/unsupervised-predict-streamlit-template)

![Movie_Recommendations](resources/imgs/Image_header.png)

This repository forms the basis of *Task 2* for the **Unsupervised Predict** within EDSA's Data Science course. It hosts template code which will enable students to deploy a basic recommender engine based upon the [Streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io/) web application framework.

As part of the predict, students are expected to expand on this base template; improving (and fixing) the given base recommender algorithms, as well as providing greater context to the problem and attempted solutions through additional application pages/functionality.
